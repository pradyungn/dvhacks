We're still in the process of formulating a proper schedule as we organize and gather the best workshops, activities, and speakers that we can. Sit tight, and keep March 5th-7th open!

The current game plan is 6PM Friday until 6AM Sunday before the "endgame" type stuff starts. We'll send out an official email detailing our official timetable at least 2 weeks prior to the event! 

**We'll be posting a proper schedule in a bit!**
