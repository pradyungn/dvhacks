**DVHacks III is the third iteration of Dougherty Valley High School's premier hackathon.**
Year after year, we've maintained a standard of **quality** and **excellence** at our events, pushing
our participants to make **interesting, complex, and creative projects** each time. With a year-by-year attendance increase
of **150 people**, we expect this to be the biggest, baddest DVHacks yet.

## Free-Form

Yes - we realize every hackathon tells you to make whatever you want. But at the same time, most hackathons weight the market viability and community impact of your projects as well. Deviating from that norm, we aren't accounting for practicality in our rubric outside of the Social Good prize. By ignoring pragmatism, we truly want to see you come up with the most creative, technically complex projects you can and let your maker run free.

## Mentor-Led Track

We know that it's really hard to get started with hackathons - especially during a pandemic! That's why the staff of the Dougherty Valley Hack Club is going to be conducting a mentor-led hackathon track! The team will walk newer participants through how to come up with an idea, how to approach different ideas, and will in general "hold your hand" throughout your first-ish hackathon. We hope that everyone, regardless of experience level, feels comfortable hacking.

## Prizes
As most people have already realized, running an online hackathon reduces costs considerably. We've taken the costs we'd normally spend on our system for prizing is unique from that of other hackathons, but it's also what makes our hackathon worth attending! Check the [about](./about) section for more information. In the meantime, this is what we'll be offering for anyone impressive enough to climb their way to the top of the heap.

In addition to whatever is listed below, we'll also send you a swag pack if you win any award :)
