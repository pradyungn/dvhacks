**DVHacks III is the third iteration of Dougherty Valley High School's premier hackathon.**
Year after year, we've maintained a standard of **quality** and **excellence** at our events, pushing
our participants to make **interesting, complex, and creative projects** each time. With a year-by-year attendance increase
of **150 people**, we expect this to be the biggest, baddest DVHacks yet.

## Free-Form

Yes - we realize every hackathon tells you to make whatever you want. But at the same time, most hackathons weight the market viability and community impact of your projects as well. Deviating from that norm, we aren't accounting for practicality in our rubric outside of the Social Good prize. By ignoring pragmatism, we truly want to see you come up with the most creative, technically complex projects you can and let your maker run free.

## Approachability

Computer Science can be daunting to start out with - especially for minorities in STEM or kids in underfunded education systems. As such, we've tried to make up for the diversity barrier where previous DVHacks haven't. By running workshops, offering a prize specifically targeted to beginners, and running the most welcoming event we can (despite it being online), we truly hope that DVHacks helps you feel at home in the making community.

## Prizes
As most people have already realized, running an online hackathon reduces costs considerably. We've taken the costs we'd normally spend on our system for prizing is unique from that of other hackathons, but it's also what makes our hackathon worth attending! Check the [about](./about) section for more information. In the meantime, this is what we'll be offering for anyone impressive enough to climb their way to the top of the heap.
